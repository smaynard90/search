# Search

This was my submission for the [first project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/) in Harvard's [Web Programming Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/).

## About
This project mostly served as an exercise in HTML/CSS design. 
I successfully recreated Google's default search, image search, and advanced search pages by breaking down the pages into divs and organizing them accordingly.
Before doing any coding, I visually outlined how each section ought to be divided. These outlines can be found in the reference folder.

## Issues
There's still some issues with dynamic resizing such that it may look appropriate on any screen/device.
